This is a clustered current status data.

id = subject id
tooth = teeth label inside a subject's mouth (Universal Numbering System)
CSTime = The current status (inspection) time of the adult tooth since emergence, in years.
delta = 1, if event observed in time [0, CSTime], = 0 (censored), if observed in [CSTime, \infty)
Female = 1 if female, 0 = male
smoke = 1 if smoker, 0 = non-smoker
Hba1c = 1 if high glycemic level, 0 = controlled
jaw = 1 if upper jaw, 0 = lower jaw [this is a tooth-level covariate]
CAL = tooth-level (mean) Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) 
BMI = Body Mass Index (a continuous subject-level covariate)
cluster size = the size (number of teeth available) for each cluster (subject). 
Age = The age of the subject at time of inspection (continuous)
